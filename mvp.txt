Writer. Maker. Life-liver.
- The failure list.

Next:
        parse out pub date, location, etc from dayone
        - Display 10 most recent posts (properly formatted)
        get image from dayone
        assemble into posts.
        - Infinite scroll to next ones
        - fix love this
        - Post types.
        - "x people agree" -> fade out

- some bugs in post type selection based on image #s.
- thumbnails image width: 896
- some bugs in image height for short/narrow images (see want sexy parallax effect)
- posts link to detail pages.
- rss feed
- fix love this multi-clicks
- // TODO:  // THe end
- dates?


- Want: sexy parallax effect
    - also, save image height in the db, so we can be clever.
